This will rapidly become an artifact of its time, because the Dolmenwood setting, developed by Nectrotic Gnome, via contributions on Patreon, is going to be changing to a standalone game rather than a setting for the Old-School Essentials ruleset, as part of an effort to no longer rely on Wizards of the Coast's OGL.

But for now the PDFs that those of us who have been using for our Dolmenwood campaigns still use OSE as it's base and this random encounter generator reflecs that.

-=The Generator Includes=-
1. html file for user input
2. javascript file that houses the random tables
3. javascript file that interacts with those files based on user in put
4. css document for making the html file look less boring

To use the Generator all you have to do is open the html file in the folder. That's it!

Some results are pretty wild:
